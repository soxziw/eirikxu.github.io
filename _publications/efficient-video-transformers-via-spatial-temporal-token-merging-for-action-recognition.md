excerpt: 'This work aims to boost the efficiency of existing video transformers for action recognition through eliminating redundancies in their tokens and efficiently learning motion cues of moving objects. We propose a lightweight and plug-and-play module, namely Spatial-temporal Token Merger (STTM), to merge the tokens belonging to the same object into a more compact representation.'
