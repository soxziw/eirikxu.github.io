Education
======
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, 2026 (expected)
* B.S. in Information and Computer Science, Peking University, 2024

Work experience
======
* Amazon, Global Mile (Logistics) Tech
  * Software Engineer Intern - Test
  * Feb 2024 - Aug 2024
  * Focused on improving complex data paths among many services of Global Mile’s Testing Infra.
  * Implemented a scheduled data verifier to ensure metrics consistency, accuracy, and testing stability for Global Mile, employing AWS cloud computing services. Reduced 30 minutes per issue for senior engineers to identify potential bugs.
  * Designed and built a full-stack test data generation tool using Java, React, TypeScript, DynamoDB. Integrated the front-end with the back-end through HTTPS and connected back-end services using RPC. Enhanced user experience with intuitive UI design, reducing onboarding time by 80%.
  * Led a team to build an automated test cases generation tool for fuzz testing, incorporating ML and LLM techniques. Increased test scenario coverage by 95% and reduced 10 engineer years workload. Won the Global Most Impactful prize of Amazon Tinc Hackathon.

* ByteDance, Data-Arch
  * Software Engineer Intern
  * Mar 2023 - Nov 2023
  * Focused on improving stability of product environment of Bytedance Recommender System Infra.
  * Refactored and improved the storage module of a high-throughput microservice, handling over 1 billion queries per second, based on Thrift, Folly. The Asynchronous improvement successfully handled big data scenario. Achieved 10% avg latency, 30% P99 latency, 50% memory usage lower.
  * Collaborated in performance and accuracy optimization on Quota, a rate limiting component of distributed microservices. Achieved a reduction in error limited ratio by 80%-90%. Reduced average latency to 30 µs, and P99 latency to 100 µs.
  * Implemented an automatic differential test for writing requests and built CI/CD pipelines.
